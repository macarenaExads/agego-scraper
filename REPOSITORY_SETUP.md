### Quick Start After Upload

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/exogroup/web-scraper.git
cd web-scraper

# Install dependencies (uses npm workspaces)
npm install

# Test AgeGo scraper
cd scrapers/agego
npm install playwright
npx playwright install chromium
node scrape_single.js "https://www.agego.com/about-us" console
```

### Root Package.json Features

- **Workspaces**: Automatically manages subdirectory packages
- **Convenience Scripts**: Run scrapers from root directory
- **Shared Dependencies**: Playwright shared across all scrapers

### Benefits for ExoGroup

1. **Scalable Structure**: Easy to add new scrapers for other projects
2. **Consistent Organization**: Standardized scraper layout
3. **Self-Contained**: Each scraper is independent
4. **Production Ready**: Includes proper gitignore, documentation, and error handling

### Next Steps

1. Upload entire `agego-scraper-package/` directory contents to the repository
2. Test with the Quick Start commands
3. Add new scrapers following the same pattern in `scrapers/<project-name>/`

The repository is now ready as a professional, scalable foundation for ExoGroup's web scraping needs.
